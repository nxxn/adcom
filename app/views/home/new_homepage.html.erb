            Natasha is the managing director of Adcom Designs. She improves communication skills and team dynamics through a relentless focus on each client’s business, brand, and competition. She manages the development of new systems, processes, and guidelines for things we don’t always quantify. Three recent years of consulting work in Asia inform the rigorous evaluation and metrics she offers our clients around the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the past 14 yeas, Natasha has developed and delivered 972 workshops and 324 webinars, written seven books in the Write It Well Series on Business Communication, and engaged in strategic communication consulting assignments with 212 clients including Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Nestlé Health Science, Haas Business School, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Booz Allen, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Shakti Foundation, Climateworks Foundation, McDonald's, Mondelēz, the Packard Foundation, California Public Utilities Commission, the Federal Reserve Bank, the City of Palo Alto, and Visa.
          </p>

          <!-- <p>
            As as program officer and management consultant in belt-tightening times, Natasha led capacity-building, strategic planning, and merger and restructuring projects that broke down barriers and captured efficiencies. Policy analysis, along with three years of consulting in Asia, sealed her conviction that all communication efforts can and should be measured and evaluated. Today, clients across the US and in Hong Kong, India, Malaysia, Japan, Australia, Thailand, and Vietnam appreciate Natasha's cultural intelligence, her analytical skills, focus on key performance indicators, and her evaluation tools and mindset.
          </p>

          <p>
            Natasha doesn't like to sit still for any longer than necessary. She loves adventure travel and being outdoors hiking, swimming, biking, and skiing. She and her husband manage two busy kids; an apricot orchard; and a ranch that's home to cows, goats, and chickens.
